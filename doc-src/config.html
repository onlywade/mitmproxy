Mitmproxy is configured through a set of files in the users ~/.mitmproxy
directory. 

<table class="table">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>mitmproxy.conf</th> 
			<td>Settings for the <b>mitmproxy</b>. This file can contain any options supported by mitmproxy.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>mitmdump.conf</th> 
			<td>Settings for the <b>mitmdump</b>. This file can contain any options supported by mitmdump.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>common.conf</th>

			<td>Settings shared between all command-line tools. Settings in
			this file are over-ridden by those in the tool-specific
			files. Only options shared by mitmproxy and mitmdump should be used in this file. </td>

# Syntax

## Comments

<pre>
# this is a comment
; this is also a comment (.ini style)
--- and this is a comment too (yaml style)
</pre>

## Key/Value pairs

- Keys and values are case-sensitive
- Whitespace is ignored
- Lists are comma-delimited, and enclosed in square brackets

<pre>
name = value   # (.ini style) 
name: value    # (yaml style)
--name value   # (command-line option style)

fruit = [apple, orange, lemon]
indexes = [1, 12, 35 , 40]
</pre>

## Flags

These are boolean options that take no value but true/false.

<pre>
name = true    # (.ini style)
name
--name 	 	   # (command-line option style)
</pre>

# Options

The options available in the config files are precisely those available as
command-line flags, with the key being the option's long name. To get a
complete list of these, use the __--help__ option on each of the tools. Be
careful to only specify common options in the __common.conf__ file -
unsupported options in this file will be detected as an error on startup.

# Examples

## common.conf

Note that __port__ is an option supported by all tools. 

<pre class="code">
port = 8080
</pre>


## mitmproxy.conf

<pre class="code">
palette = light
</pre>
